       "'A surprisingly robust peak season is taking shape at U.S. seaports. Container imports are flowing back into the U.S. in bigger volumes, the WSJ Logistics Report’s Costas Paris writes, as U.S. retailers rush to restock while consumer spending remains strong and shipping lines push capacity back into commercial trade lanes. The growth is accelerating at both the Atlantic and Pacific gateways but appears stronger recently on the West Coast, where retailers have faster access to domestic distribution channels primed for e-commerce. The surge comes after several retailers reported that stock shortages limited their sales growth as coronavirus-driven lockdowns wound down and shoppers opened their wallets. The demand is driving freight rates to new multi-year highs, boosting an unexpectedly strong financial year for shipping lines. Research group Sea Intelligence says sector-wide operating earnings reached $2.7 billion in the second quarter, and growing third-quarter volumes should add to the profitability. The downturn in North American rail volume this year is hitting the transportation equipment market harder. Railcar manufacturers are extending cost cuts and looking to make some cutbacks permanent, the WSJ’s Kristin Broughton reports, as the sector copes with an oversupply of cars and declining freight loads. Dallas-based manufacturer and lessor Trinity Industries is looking at ways to outsource the making of railcars so it can reduce labor costs permanently after losing $206.9 million in the second quarter. Greenbrier Companies had cut its North American workforce by 40% by midsummer and closed 11 rail production lines. Overall U.S. rail volumes fell by 11.8% in the first eight months of the year, according to the Association of American Railroads, pushing operators to park their equipment. Some 29% of North American freight cars were in storage last month, according to the AAR, up from 16% two years ago. “People may not go out for a drink, but they will spend money on a pair of sneakers or to get home appliances.” A BNSF coal train leaving the Black Thunder Mine near Wright, Wyo., in July. There are still some embers burning in the cooling coal market. Rising natural gas prices and limited supply are pushing some utilities to increase their use of coal, the WSJ’s Jinjoo Lee reports, giving a bit of a boost to a market that’s been in a retreat. U.S. regulators estimate that coal’s long-declining share of electricity generation will tick up to 22% in 2021 from 18% this year. The share for natural gas-fired power will decline to 35% from 40%, a reversal that shows how sensitive the cutthroat natural-gas market is to shifts in prices and supply. Still, it will do little to salvage a coal business that remains bleak for transportation companies. Coal carloads on U.S. railroads were down 27.3% in the first eight months of this year, according to the AAR, and transports last month were the lowest for any August in records dating back 32 years. Warehousing and storage jobs added in the U.S. from July to August, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. U.S. employers added 1.4 million jobs last month and the unemployment rate fell to 8.4%. China’s export growth accelerated last month as outbound shipments rose 9.5%. The euro has climbed 5.6% against the dollar this year and is near all-time high on a trade-weighted basis. The Trump administration is weighing export restrictions on Semiconductor Manufacturing International, China’s most advanced chip maker. Aviation safety regulators are reviewing quality-control lapses in Boeing’s jetliner production potentially stretching back almost a decade. Amazon is barring foreign sales of seeds into the U.S. after thousands of suspicious packets arrived at American households from China this summer. European banks have grown wary of financing commodity traders, raising borrowing costs in the market for raw materials. President Trump says he supports an investigation into Postmaster General Louis DeJoy’s political fundraising while at New Breed Logistics. Venezuela shut down its last working oil drilling rig. Bangladesh’s textile exports soared nearly 50% in August as factories rushed to meet orders from global retailers. The coronavirus pandemic has forced many small businesses to finally open online stores—and turned e-commerce software provider Shopify into one of the biggest winners of the retail shakeout. FedEx plans to add 70,000 temporary workers to handle an “unprecedented peak holiday shipping season.” Walmart is toughening its supplier delivery requirements ahead of the holiday season. Amazon will open a grocery store in leftover space at a downsized Kohl’s department store in Milwaukee. Australian online payments company Afterpay is expanding into more countries after doubling its customer base over the past year. North American digital sales at Ralph Lauren have grown only 3% since the first quarter. Russia’s Sovcomflot and Novatek ordered 10 icebreaking liquefied natural gas carriers to export cargoes from an Arctic facility. CMA CGM’s operating profit rose 26% in the first half of the year over last year. Volkswagen’s heavy-truck business plans to make a fresh push to acquire truck maker Navistar International. Amazon Air is expanding operations with its first owned Boeing 767-300 freighter.'"
